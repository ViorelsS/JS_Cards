# 🃏 Dynamic Cards Display

A simple web page that dynamically displays cards with data fetched from a JavaScript array. The rendering of the cards is done entirely using **JavaScript**, without hardcoding the card structure in the HTML. This project is based on a tutorial from [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/@briandesign).

## 🚀 Features

-   Dynamically renders a list of cards from a JavaScript array.
-   Each card displays information such as a title, description, and image.
-   Clean and responsive design using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: Basic structure of the page.
-   **CSS**: Styling for the layout and cards.
-   **JavaScript**: Logic for dynamically generating the cards from an array of data.

## 📋 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viorelss/dynamic-cards.git
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the dynamically generated cards.
